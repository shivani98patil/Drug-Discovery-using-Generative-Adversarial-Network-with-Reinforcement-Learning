# Drug-Discovery-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network-with-Reinforcement-Learning


**Introduction-**
1. Drug development timelines are long and they depend upon numerous factors<br />
2. Drug Development needs about 15-16 years and billions of dollars to launch the drug in the market.<br /> 
3. Overall failure rate is 96% and 90% of the drugs fail in first clinical trail itself. Hence it is important to come with a better and reliable approach to solve this problem<br />
4. The problem can be solved by using sophisticated Deep Learning algorithms to ensure the drug discovery is faster and also overcomes the problem of failure in trails<br />
5. Deep Learning approach improves discovery and decision making using abundant and high-quality data<br />

**Programming Language** - Python<br />
**Modules** - Tensorflow and Rdkit<br />
**Data** - ZINC*

We have solved the above mentioned problem in this project.
