# Drug-Discovery-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network-with-Reinforcement-Learning


**Introduction-**
1. Drug development timelines are long and they depend upon numerous factors<br />
2. Drug Development needs about 15-16 years and billions of dollars to launch the drug in the market.<br /> 
3. Overall failure rate is 96% and 90% of the drugs fail in first clinical trail itself. Hence it is important to come with a better and reliable approach to solve this problem<br />
4. The problem can be solved by using sophisticated Deep Learning algorithms to ensure the drug discovery is faster and also overcomes the problem of failure in trails<br />
5. Deep Learning approach improves discovery and decision making using abundant and high-quality data<br />

**Survey-**<br />
When surveyed about Artificial Intelligence used in Health Care Industry. Some of the approaches taken by the researchers were<br />
	1. Vibrational auto encoders<br />
	2. Adversarial auto encoders<br />
	3. RNN with Reinforcement learning<br />
	4. Generative Adversarial Network<br />
In the above research paper referred, models used images as their input. <br />
Also, the finding showed that GAN model have different problems like<br />
	A. Generator and Discriminator are given image data as input.<br />
	B. When generator generates incomplete samples which are given directly to the discriminator.<br />

**Programming Language** - Python<br />
**Modules** - Tensorflow and Rdkit<br />
**Data** - ZINC*

We have tried solving the above mentioned problem in this project.
